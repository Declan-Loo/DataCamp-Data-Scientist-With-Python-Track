Building a command line data app
You are building a command line tool that lets a user interactively explore a dataset. We've defined four functions: mean(), std(), minimum(), and maximum() that users can call to analyze their data. Help finish this section of the code so that your users can call any of these functions by typing the function name at the input prompt.

Note: The function get_user_input() in this exercise is a mock version of asking the user to enter a command. It randomly returns one of the four function names. In real life, you would ask for input and wait until the user entered a value.

Reviewing your co-worker's code
Your co-worker is asking you to review some code that they've written and give them some tips on how to get it ready for production. You know that having a docstring is considered best practice for maintainable, reusable functions, so as a sanity check you decide to run this has_docstring() function on all of their functions.

Returning functions for a math game
You are building an educational math game where the player enters a math term, and your program returns a function that matches that term. For instance, if the user types "add", your program returns a function that adds two numbers. So far you've only implemented the "add" function. Now you want to include a "subtract" function.
